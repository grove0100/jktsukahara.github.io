I am a prospective PhD student at Sorbonne Université, working with [Elias Tsigaridas](https://who.paris.inria.fr/Elias.Tsigaridas/index.html) and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](https://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/research.html). I hold a BSc and an MSc in Mathematics from King's College London, and an [M2 in Mathematics and Machine Learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) from ENS Paris-Saclay.

I am interested in computational algebraic geometry and [singular learning theory](https://sites.google.com/view/sumiowatanabe/home), and their application to biology.
