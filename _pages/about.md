Hello, my name is Jules Tsukahara. I am a prospective PhD student at Sorbonne Université, working with Elias Tsigaridas and Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis. I hold a BSc and an MSc in Mathematics from King's College London, and an M2 in Mathematics and Machine Learning from ENS Paris-Saclay.

I am interested in computational algebraic geometry and singular learning theory, and their application to biology.
